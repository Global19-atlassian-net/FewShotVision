# A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification

This repo contains the reference source code for the paper [A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkxLXnAcFQ) in International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2019). In this project, we provide a integrated testbed for a detailed empirical study for few-shot classification.

## Enviroment
 - Python3
 - [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) 1.1
 - CUDA 10

## Getting started

### Installation

Git clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:sicara/FewShotLearning.git
```

Then `cd FewShotLearning` and install virtualenv:

```
virtualenv venv --python=python3
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### CUB
* run `source ./scripts/downloaders/download_CUB.sh`

### mini-ImageNet
* run `source ./scripts/downloaders/download_miniImagenet.sh`

(WARNING: This would download the 155G ImageNet dataset.)

### mini-ImageNet->CUB (cross)
* Finish preparation for CUB and mini-ImageNet and you are done!

### Omniglot
* run `source ./scripts/downloaders/download_omniglot.sh` 

### Omniglot->EMNIST (cross_char) WARNING: not tested yet
* Finish preparation for omniglot first
* Change directory to `./filelists/emnist`
* run `source ./download_emnist.sh`  

### Self-defined setting
* Require three data split json file: 'base.json', 'val.json', 'novel.json' for each dataset  
* The format should follow   
{"label_names": ["class0","class1",...], "image_names": ["filepath1","filepath2",...],"image_labels":[l1,l2,l3,...]}  
See test.json for reference
* Put these file in the same folder and change data_dir['DATASETNAME'] in configs.py to the folder path  

## Train
Run
```python ./train.py --dataset [DATASETNAME] --model [BACKBONENAME] --method [METHODNAME] [--OPTIONARG]```

For example, run `python ./train.py --dataset miniImagenet --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug`  
Commands below follow this example, and please refer to io_utils.py for additional options.

## Save features
Save the extracted feature before the classifaction layer to increase test speed. This is not applicable to MAML, but are required for other methods.
Run
```python ./save_features.py --dataset miniImagenet --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug```

## Test
Run
```python ./test.py --dataset miniImagenet --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug```

## Results
* The test results will be recorded in `./record/results.txt`
* For all the pre-computed results, please see `./record/few_shot_exp_figures.xlsx`. This will be helpful for including your own results for a fair comparison.
